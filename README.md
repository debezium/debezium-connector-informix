# Debezium Connector for Informix

This repository is an incubating Debezium Connector for [Informix Database](https://www.ibm.com/products/informix). We appreciated you can explore this connector and test it, and any feedback and contribution are welcome. This project aim for a community-ready Debezium Connector, which like many other official debezium connectors.

This codebase is derived from two projects: [debezium-connector-db2](https://github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-db2) and [debezium-informix-connector](https://github.com/laoflch/debezium-informix-connector). Thanks for originated ideas and Proof-of-Concept about how to integrate Informix CDC API with Debezium Connector Frameworks.
